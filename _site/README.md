Rings as a timeline

This project use jekyll to create the mockup, it will eventually be upgraded to React or similar.

To see this project just open the compiled files at: _site/index.html  in your local browser

But if you want to modify it you need to install jekyll. 

```
$ gem install jekyll bundler
```

make any change you need on the un-compiled files (root of the folder). When ready:

```
$jekyll build
```

Then check again _site/index.html   

you can also run a watch to build automatically:

```
jekyll build --watch
```
